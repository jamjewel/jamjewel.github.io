                            This project was undertaken to do stance classification of tweet and discovering the best fitting deep learning model that can successfully classify stance (FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE) based on particular Target (topic) about a tweet.Final selection was made of LSTM model as they proved to work best in natural language processing scenario. Analysing intra variability of classes and imbalancing of data, efforts were taken to choose a balanced data set for training purpose. glove MODEL trained on wikipedia data was used .The data was transformed to task vocabulary to fit the model. The model after large iterations of fine tuning made it robust and provided an accuracy score on validation as 52.97 and test score as 53.8 respectively.

                        <p>
                            This project was undertaken to  discover the best fitting machine learning model which can successfully classify images based on two factors, namely shape and labels. Three different ML model development techniques were employed : MLP, CNN . The CNN model proved to be highly accurate .Analysis of intra variability of classes and comparison of classification performance of four Convolutional Neural Networks based on parameter tuning gave us the optimal model. The images provided are grey scaled and sized to a 28*28 density. The development of the model has three stages: image preprocessing, detection, and recognition. The model demonstrated a promising result with an accuracy of 81 %for shape classification and 62% for label classification. Independent evaluation was done by collecting images from internet sources and real time clicks of victorian, Melbourne streets.

                            95% of Australian sugar is grown in Queensland, and sugarcane is the second-highest export crop after wheat as it contributes 2.5 billion dollars to the Australian economy. Developed the time series model (FB Prophet) to forecast the overestimation and underestimation of sugarcane for sugar mills using Satellite imagery datasets of sugarcane fields at Queensland. Processed the image data using python libraries and Google cloud services and also merged that dataset with weather and soil quality datasets to find the correlation and improve the performance of the model.
